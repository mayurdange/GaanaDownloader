## Gaana:

[Gaana](http://gaana.com/) is a music streaming free service. There are also mobile Apps that allow users to listen to music for free in their mobiles. 

The mobile App features unlimited download of songs for a small amount of fee. The catch here is that the downloaded songs can be listed through the Gaana App only.
