A Java tool to download and convert songs to MP3 from Gaana in Bulk

## Gaana:

[Gaana](http://gaana.com/) is a music streaming free service. There are also mobile Apps that allow users to listen to music for free in their mobiles. 

The mobile App features unlimited download of songs for a small amount of fee. The catch here is that the downloaded songs can be listed through the Gaana App only. 

Using this utility, songs can be downloaded in bulk and converted to audio files with proper tags
Also there is an option to organize the songs into folders named under their Album names

## Usage:

1. Download the latest GaanaDownloader zip file from the below link
2. Extract the zip file
3. Run the GaanaDownloader.bat(Windows) or GaanaDownloader.sh(Linux)
4. A console is opened. Proceed as indicated in the displayed console
5. After everything the downloaded & converted songs should be in the folder 'Downloaded_Songs/converted'
6. Enjoy the songs!

**Note1** : Internet connected is required for this utility to get the song details from the Gaana Server.

**Note2** : If there is any error during the process, please share the log files with me. The log files can be found in the same directory as that of the bat/sh file. It will be under the extension 'log'. If there was no error during conversion, the log file can be deleted.
